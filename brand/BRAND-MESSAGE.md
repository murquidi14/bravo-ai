## The Culture

### Who We Are

We're not a software company that sells to fabricators.
We're fabricators who built software.

We don't add features to a roadmap and forget about them.
We ship custom solutions weekly.

We don't make you click through 47 screens.
We let you text what you need.

We don't charge enterprise prices for enterprise headaches.
We charge fair prices for software that actually works.

### Our Values

**1. SIMPLER**
- If it's complicated, we're doing it wrong
- Text beats clicks
- One conversation beats ten meetings
- If your guy on the shop floor can't use it, it's not ready

**2. CHEAPER**
- No bloated pricing
- No hidden fees
- No "contact sales for pricing" games
- Fair value for real results

**3. BETTER**
- AI-native, not AI-bolted-on
- Custom solutions, not one-size-fits-all
- Weekly improvements, not annual updates
- Partners, not vendors

**4. FASTER**
- "Done by Friday" is a promise
- Custom solutions in days, not months
- Go live in weeks, not quarters
- Your request today = your feature this week

## The Origin Story

Mario Urquidi didn't set out to build software.

He ran a steel fabrication shop. Two companies — Del Bravo Steel and Del Bravo Erectors. He lived the chaos: POs lost in email, material without MTRs, the shop asking "where's the heat number?" for the hundredth time.

He tried the big software. PowerFab. Strumis. Expensive. Complex. Still required his team to click through endless screens just to answer simple questions.

So he built something different.

AI that his guys could text. "Where's heat A7823?" — and get an answer in seconds. No training required. No desktop software. Just results.

That's Bravo AI.

**Built by a fabricator. For fabricators.**

## The Sales Pitch (30 seconds)

> "You know how PowerFab costs $50k to set up and your guys still can't find material without calling someone?
>
> We built shop management software you can text. Your foreman asks 'Where's heat A7823?' and gets an instant answer. Your PM asks 'What shipped today?' and gets a list.
>
> Simpler to use. Cheaper to buy. Better because it's built with AI from day one.
>
> And when you need something custom? We don't add it to a roadmap. We build it by Friday.
>
> That's Bravo AI."
