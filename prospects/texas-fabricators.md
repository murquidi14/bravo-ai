## Targeting Strategy

### Start With:
1. **Local El Paso shops** — Warm market, understand regional challenges
2. **Mid-size fabricators** (20-100 employees) — Big enough to have pain, small enough to move fast
3. **Shops with own erection crews** — Similar to Del Bravo's model

### Best Prospects Have:
- Growing but feeling the operational pain
- Shop + field operations (more complexity = more value from AI)
- Tech-curious leadership (willing to try new approaches)
- AISC certified (indicates quality focus, process orientation)

### Avoid For Now:
- Huge national players (long sales cycles, procurement headaches)
- Tiny 5-person shops (may not have budget or complexity)
- Pure distributors without fab (different pain points)
