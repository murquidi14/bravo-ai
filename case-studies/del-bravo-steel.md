# Case Study: Del Bravo Steel Group

## When Your Shop Runs Smoother Than Your Competitors Think Is Possible

---

## Who They Are

**Del Bravo Steel Group** — El Paso, Texas

Full-service structural steel fabricator with their own erection crews. 50+ people between the shop and the field. They do everything from detailing to delivery to setting iron.

Not a huge corporate outfit. A real shop, built by people who know what it takes to get steel out the door and in the air.

---

## The Problem

Del Bravo was growing. More jobs, more pieces, more guys asking questions.

And like most shops, they were drowning in the same problems everyone has:

### The Whiteboard Was the "System"

Job status? Check the whiteboard. If someone remembered to update it. If you could read the handwriting. If you were actually in the shop to see it.

### Group Texts Were Out of Control

Every question went to the group chat:
- *"Did load 4 ship?"*
- *"Where's the W12x26 for job 2847?"*
- *"What's the heat number on that plate?"*
- *"Who's got the keys to the forklift?"*

The same 10 questions, asked 10 different ways, every single day.

### Supervisors Were Secretaries

Shop leads — guys who should be running production — were spending half their day answering phone calls and texts. The office was constantly interrupting the floor for piece counts, shipping info, and job status.

### Paperwork Was a Nightmare

BOLs done by hand. QC docs scattered across folders. Heat numbers tracked in spreadsheets that nobody updated. Every shipment meant 15 minutes of paperwork that could've been fab time.

> *"We were spending more time chasing information than moving iron."*

---

## What We Built

No off-the-shelf software that tries to make you change how you run your shop.

We built an AI system **around the way Del Bravo actually works**.

### Shop Assistant on Telegram

The guys already had Telegram on their phones. Now they've got an assistant that knows every job, every piece, every load.

Ask it anything:
- *"What's left to fab on 2847?"*
- *"Did the truck leave for Midland?"*
- *"What's the piece mark on grid line 4?"*

Answer in seconds. No phone calls. No walking to the office. No waiting.

### Plugged Into PowerFab

The AI talks directly to their shop system. Real data, real-time. Not some report that's already outdated by the time you print it.

### BOLs That Write Themselves

Load the truck, tell the system what's on it — BOL generated automatically with the right piece marks, weights, heat numbers, and descriptions. Done.

### QC On Demand

Need the MTRs for a shipment? Need to pull QC docs for an RFI response? The AI finds it and compiles it. No more digging through file cabinets.

## How Long It Took

| Phase | Time |
|-------|------|
| Discovery — learning their jobs, systems, and how the shop runs | 1 week |
| Build — setting up the AI, connecting to PowerFab, training on their data | 2 weeks |
| Testing — running it on real scenarios, fixing edge cases | 1 week |
| Training — getting the crews up to speed | 1 week |

**5 weeks from kickoff to fully operational.**

Not months. Not a year-long "digital transformation." Five weeks.

## The Results

### By the Numbers

| What Changed | Before | After |
|--------------|--------|-------|
| Time answering "where is it" questions | 2+ hours/day | Almost zero |
| BOL creation | 10-15 min each | Instant |
| Looking up job info | 5-10 min | Seconds |
| Supervisor time on admin BS | 30% of their day | Less than 5% |

### What the Guys Say

> *"I used to get 20 calls a day asking where stuff was. Now they ask the bot and leave me alone."*
> — Shop Lead

> *"It knows our jobs better than half the guys here. And it doesn't take smoke breaks."*
> — Ops Manager

### The Real Win

**Supervisors are supervising again.**

They're not on their phones answering the same questions over and over. They're on the floor making sure production runs.

**The office isn't babysitting the shop.**

They've got their own access to the same information. No more calling the floor every 10 minutes.

**Decisions happen faster.**

When you can get answers in seconds instead of hours, everything moves quicker. Jobs ship on time. Problems get caught early.

---

## What It Cost

This was a **Starter-level engagement** — under $15K all-in.

### ROI Math

Just on time savings alone:
- 2 hours/day saved
- $50/hour loaded labor cost
- 250 working days

**= $25,000/year back in your pocket**

That's a payback in less than 6 months. Everything after that is gravy.

And that's not counting:
- Fewer errors
- Faster job closeouts
- Customers who get answers quicker
- Less turnover because your people aren't frustrated

## Why It Worked

### We Know This Industry

We're not software guys who read about construction. We run a fab shop. We know what it's like when the GC is calling for shipping dates and your lead is out sick and nobody can find the damn piece list.

We built this for ourselves first. Then we realized every shop has the same problems.

### It Fits How You Work

Nobody wants another system to learn. Another login to remember. Another app that "requires training."

This runs on Telegram — something your guys already have. Ask a question in plain English, get an answer. Done.

### It's Built Around YOUR Shop

Not some generic template. The AI learns your job numbers, your piece marks, your terminology, your people. It works the way you work.

---

## The Bottom Line

Del Bravo went from chasing information all day to having answers at their fingertips.

Their supervisors are back to running production. Their office isn't playing phone tag with the shop. Their paperwork basically does itself.

**Same crew. Same equipment. Same jobs. Just running smoother.**

---

## Sound Familiar?

If you're running a fab shop and this sounds like your day, let's talk.

We're not going to sell you a bunch of software and wish you luck. We'll come in, learn how your shop runs, and build something that actually works for you.

**60-day guarantee:** If you don't see real improvement, we keep working until you do.
