## Template 1: The Direct Approach

**Connection Request Note:**
```
Hey [FIRST NAME] — saw you're running ops at [COMPANY]. We work with steel fabricators on AI systems that cut the "where's my beam?" calls in half. Not trying to sell you anything, just curious if that's a pain point for you too.
```

**Follow-up if they accept:**
```
Thanks for connecting, [FIRST NAME].

Quick question — how much time does your team spend answering the same status questions every day? "Where's this job?" "Did that load ship?" etc.

We built AI assistants for our own fab shop that handle all that automatically. Saves our supervisors a couple hours a day.

If you're ever curious how it works, happy to show you. No pitch, just a 15-minute demo. Either way, good to connect with others in the industry.
```

## Template 2: The Peer Approach

**Connection Request Note:**
```
[FIRST NAME] — fellow fabricator here in Texas. We've been testing some AI tools in our shop that are actually working. Happy to share what we've learned if you're interested.
```

**Follow-up if they accept:**
```
Good to connect.

Not sure if you're dealing with this, but our biggest time drain was answering the same questions all day:
- Where's this piece?
- Did that truck leave?
- What's the status on job X?

We built an AI assistant that handles all that — guys just text it and get answers instantly.

Cut our admin overhead in half. Supervisors actually supervise now.

Want me to show you how it works? 15 minutes, no BS. If it's not for you, no worries.
```

## Template 3: The Observation Approach

**Connection Request Note:**
```
[FIRST NAME] — noticed [COMPANY] has been growing. We help fabricators scale without the growing pains. Let me know if you'd ever want to compare notes.
```

**Follow-up:**
```
Hey [FIRST NAME],

When we were scaling our shop, the hardest part wasn't the work — it was the communication overhead. More jobs meant more questions, more phone calls, more "where's this?" all day long.

We built AI systems that handle all those repetitive questions automatically. Our guys just text the bot and get instant answers. BOLs generate themselves. QC docs are a click away.

If you're hitting those same growing pains, might be worth a conversation. 15-20 minutes, I'll show you exactly what we built.

Either way, congrats on the growth.
```

## Template 4: The Specific Pain Point

**Connection Request Note:**
```
[FIRST NAME] — quick question: how much time does your shop spend on paperwork that could be automated? We've solved this for a few fabricators and I'm curious if it's a pain point for you too.
```

# Email Templates

## Template 1: Cold Email — Direct

**Subject:** Quick question about [COMPANY]

```
Hey [FIRST NAME],

I'll keep this short.

We run a steel fab shop in El Paso. Last year we built AI systems to stop the constant "where's my piece?" phone calls. It worked — our supervisors got 2 hours back every day.

Now we're helping other fabricators do the same.

If you're dealing with:
- Shop leads spending half their day answering status questions
- BOLs and shipping docs eating up time
- Field crews bugging the shop for updates

...might be worth a 15-minute call.

If not, no worries — just figured I'd reach out to someone who gets it.

## Template 2: Cold Email — Problem Focused

**Subject:** The "where's my beam?" problem

```
[FIRST NAME],

Every fabricator I talk to has the same problem:

Supervisors who should be running production are instead playing secretary — answering the same questions all day. "Did that load ship?" "What's the piece mark on grid line 4?" "Where's the MTR for this plate?"

We fixed this at our own shop with AI. Now our guys just text a bot and get instant answers. No phone calls. No walking to the office. No waiting.

Want to see how it works? 15 minutes, I'll demo exactly what we built.

Worst case, you'll see what's possible. Best case, we save your team a few hours a day.

## Template 3: Cold Email — Credibility Play

**Subject:** How we run our fab shop

```
[FIRST NAME],

I'm not a software salesman. I run a steel fabrication shop in El Paso — Del Bravo Steel.

A couple years ago, we were drowning in the same stuff everyone deals with:
- Whiteboards that were always outdated
- Group texts out of control
- Supervisors who couldn't supervise because they were answering questions all day

So we built AI assistants to handle it. They know every job, every piece, every shipment. Our guys just ask and get instant answers.

Now we're helping other fabricators build the same thing.

If you're curious, I'll show you exactly how it works — 15 minutes, no pitch.

## Template 4: Follow-Up Email (if no response)

**Subject:** RE: [Original Subject]

```
Hey [FIRST NAME],

Just bumping this up. Figured it might've gotten buried.

Quick version: we help fabricators automate the repetitive stuff — status questions, BOLs, QC docs.

If timing's not right, no worries. If you're curious, here's my calendar: [CALENDLY LINK]

## Template 5: Breakup Email (3rd attempt)

**Subject:** Should I close your file?

```
[FIRST NAME],

I've reached out a couple times and haven't heard back. Totally get it — you're busy running a shop.

I'll assume the timing isn't right and won't keep bugging you.

If things change and you want to see how we're helping fabricators automate their operations, you know where to find me.

Good luck with everything.
