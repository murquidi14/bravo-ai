## About Bravo AI

We're not consultants who've never set foot on a job site.

We own and operate a steel fabrication facility and erection company. We built AI systems for ourselves first — to solve the same problems you're dealing with. Then we realized every shop has these problems.

**Our approach:**
- Built for construction, not adapted from other industries
- We implement it with you, not just hand you a report
- Long-term partnership, not a one-time project

---

## Next Steps

1. **Questions?** — Let's talk through anything that's not clear
2. **Ready to move?** — Sign the attached agreement
3. **Kickoff** — We'll schedule our first working session within 48 hours
